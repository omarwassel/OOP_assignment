## requirement
1.	Write a class whose instances represent a single playing card from a deck of cards. Playing cards have two distinguishing properties: rank and suit. Be sure to keep your solution as you will be asked to rewrite it in [Enum Types](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/QandE/enum-answers.html).
2.	Write a class whose instances represent a full deck of cards. You should also keep this solution.
3.	Write a small program to test your deck and card classes. The program can be as simple as creating a deck of cards and displaying its cards.
